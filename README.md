# Inferring Hidden Attentional States in Driving:
This repository contains the code and data processing pipeline for the paper "Inferring Hidden Attentional States in Driving: A Bayesian Approach to Modeling Distraction and Secondary Task Engagement." The study introduces a personalized modeling framework based on a Partially Observable Semi-Markov Decision Process (POSMDP) to infer latent attentional states and estimate individual reward functions.


- `Data/`: Contains training sets, test sets, and ground truth labels for each of the 18 participants (`P1` to `P18`).
- `POSMDP_on_Driver_distraction_level.ipynb`: Main notebook to run the model, estimate dynamics, learn rewards, and evaluate predictions.
