# Inferring Hidden Attentional States in Driving:
This repository contains the code and data processing pipeline for the paper "Inferring Hidden Attentional States in Driving: A Bayesian Approach to Modeling Distraction and Secondary Task Engagement." The study introduces a personalized modeling framework based on a Partially Observable Semi-Markov Decision Process (POSMDP) to infer latent attentional states and estimate individual reward functions.
